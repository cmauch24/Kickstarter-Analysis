# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project consisted of sorting, analyzing, and presenting data about fundraising campaigns across multiple regions and types of campaigns. This was done using Microsoft Excel and its built in functions and tools.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create a visual representation that helps to determine the outcome of Kickstarter Campaigns for theatre as it relates to their launch dates and fundraising goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
To complete this analysis, two visual sources were created. One looks at the success, failure, or cancellation of theatre campaigns by month across all years that data is available. The other looks at the success, failure, or cancellation of theatre campaigns based on their fundraising goals. Both data sets were compiled into line graphs. 

Challenges faced when completing this analysis were ensuring that the correct formula was used for calculation of outcomes vs goal and compiling the analysis into a format easy to consume by the audience.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 

Based on the graph above, we see that May has the highest amount of successful campaign outcomes with 111 out of 166 campaigns ending in success. We also see that, with the exception of November to December, there is a direct correlation between the number of successful campaigns and the number of failed campaigns. While the numeric increase might be sharper for one outcome vs the other, the trends follow one another.

Despite the overall positive nature of the successful outcomes, it is recommended that caution is used when launching. The sharp downturn in success after May tells us that campaign leaders should launch their campaigns early in Q2 of the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
 

Based on the graph above, we see that campaigns with a goal under $20000 are more likely to be successful, while campaigns above that threshold will have more volatility. Over 50% of campaigns staying under the $20000 mark for their goal saw success, with stronger results the lower the dollar amount went.

While the majority of campaigns aiming to raise more than $20000 were unsuccessful, 65% of campaigns with a fundraising goal between $35000 and $45000 were successful. Based on this data, the audience may consider a goal between $35000 and $45000 if they would like to establish a campaign aiming to raise more than $20000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- Looking at the data, two conclusions that we can draw when analyzing outcomes vs launch dates are that May is the most successful time to launch a campaign and that there is a direct correlation in success and failure rates.

- Across all years, the month of May say 110 successful campaign launches. No other single month had more than 75 successful launches. In addition, 

- Based on the data, we can draw the conclusion that campaigns with a goal over $20000 are more likely to fail than succeed. While success isn’t impossible to achieve (over 60% of campaigns with a goal of $35000-$45000 were successful) failure of campaigns with a goal over the $20000 mark is more common.

- Some limitations of this dataset are that we are looking at a very specific type of campaign while not factoring in other variables. How long were these campaigns running? What markets were these campaigns targeting? While the data that we have compiled is useful, it doesn’t paint the entire picture when considering whether or not all theatre kickstarters will be successful or not

- To truly capture an analysis for this data, it is recommended that a column graph displaying outcomes by region be created. This will tell us which areas may have more success than others.
